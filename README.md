# demo.sh

Script the boring stuff in your demo, leaving room for doing the nail-biting
parts of your demo live and unedited.

Comments and commands appear to be "typed", freeing the presenter to talk
about what is happening as it happens. Typing speed is configurable.
SIGINT (`Ctrl-C`) works as you'd expect, and SIGQUIT (`Ctrl-\`) will
"shell out" at any point during the scripted demo for those impromptu live
tweaks.

Check out the [example](example.sh) along with the asciinema:
