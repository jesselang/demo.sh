# demo.sh

`demo.sh` lets you orchestrate the mundane parts of your demo, while
offering the ability to "shell out" to an interactive shell for the live
portion of your demo, then continue the
scripted content. Comments and commands appear to be "typed", freeing the
presenter to talk about what is happening as it happens, and the speed is
configurable. Ctrl-C will interrupt the script, and Ctrl-T will "shell out" at
any point during the scripted demo.

Check out the [example](example.sh) along with the asciinema:
